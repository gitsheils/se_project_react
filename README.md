**Intro**
The WTWR website recommends clothing items to wear depending on the current weather. The website features user registration to personalize clothing items for each user. User features include updating his/her profile, creating clothing items, and liking and disliking items. These website features send requests to a backend Express server whose server logic was written in another project (https://github.com/gitsheils/se_project_express).
